# Slide-Puzzle

A sliding puzzle is a game in which the player moves tiles on a grid. In this case the puzzle is 4x4 and contains one empty space, allowing players to slide adjacent tiles into the empty space. The objective is to arrange each tile in the correct position after the tiles have been shuffled.
