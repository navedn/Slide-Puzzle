      The goal of the fifteen puzzle is to un-jumble its fifteen squares by
      repeatedly making moves that slide squares into the empty space. How
      quickly can you solve it?

      American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely
      credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891 until
      his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created
      around 1874 by Noyles Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
